First Fill in your ipv4 address in line #9 of Client.java
Socket s = new Socket("ipv4", 4999);

Ways to run
#Way 1
First
- Run the Server.java file to start the server
Second
- open up to 4 new terminals and Run Client.java

#Way2
In terminal type
- javac Server.java
- javac Client.java
Then
- java Server
- java Client, up to 4 times in new terminals

Currently GUI hasnt been set up (so ignore the GUI files and code)

Once Server is Live and you have up to 4 clients connected
Follow the Instructions in the terminal
Either type an existing username OR type NEW followed by a space, then create a new username

if done using multiple clients each person can send messages to the server which will respond with the message back to each connected client

If your port number 4999 is being used, change it to a free port in Client.java line #9 and Server.java in line #62
